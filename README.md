# Project Title

Weather Info App 
1. Search by city name or zip code
Implement a search to allow the user to enter a city name or zip code. The result of the search is to display the current weather information for the searched location.
 
2. Search by GPS
On the same search screen, also allow user to use GPS location instead to get current weather information.
 
3. Most recent search location loads automatically
When you come back to the app after closing it, the weather for the most recent search is displayed.
